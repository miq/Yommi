Ideas and ToDos for creating and shaping Your Own Multi-Media Infrastructure

## Setting
Digital photography and video recording available today leads to tons of
photos and videos laying around somewhere on your devices and maybe on the
NAS in your home network.

As easy as it is to produce new digital content as hard it is to browse
and show it in a convenient way. Often you have to pass around your
smart phone or navigate somewhere into unintuitive directory structures
on your TV to (not) find the photos you wanted to show.

## Goal
Use existing open source tools to make organizing and showing all your
media a joy.

## Concept

### Organize
Use an organizer tool to add metadata to photos and put them in a systematic
and ordered directory structure. The organizer may have to be run on some
desktop/laptop computer. It creates and manages your "digital media library".

Examples: shotwell, iPhoto, digikam etc.

### Provide
A network service/server tool provides convenient access to your media
library over the network. That way you can show your media easily on
different display devices like your smart TV or smart phone. Fortunately,
a relatively wide spread solution exists in the form of DLNA.

Examples: Universal Media Server (UMS)

### View
Your media provided over the network can be viewed on a wide range of devices.
Many devices out there support already DLNA servers directly or by installing
some kind of app. That way you can show your media to family and friends 
on the best fitting device for the given situation.
Existing solutions may be enriched by providing a mobile first progressive
web app which either accesses your media library directly or the underlying
DLNA server whichever is more convenient.

Examples: None known, research & development to be done.
